    <p class="paragraph">The task is a computer vision challenge to detect characters in input images, emphasizing image
      processing, analysis, and modern deep learning techniques. It's more aligned with computer vision than Optical
      Character Recognition (OCR), utilizing various models like ResNet, Xception, Inception, and MobileNet to process
      and analyze the dataset for accurate predictions.</p>

    <p class="paragraph">Nowadays, companies using paper-based systems are striving to improve their system’s
      performance by digitalizing their information. A digital system provides a secure and easy way of sharing and
      retrieving information, which is one of the main issues in a paper-based system. This problem becomes a burden as
      paper stacks up, since productivity is tied to the amount of time wasted searching for a relevant piece of
      information. Meaning as paper stacks up, productivity goes down.</p>
    <a href="home.html" target="_blank" class="project-link">Welcome to Character Recognition</a>
    <p class="paragraph">Fortunately, Optical Character Recognition, OCR in short, is the key for solving this problem.
      OCR is a way of converting text written on a paper or an unsearchable PDF to a searchable, editable format. Thus,
      companies utilizing this technology can digitalize their systems in an incredibly short time, relatively speaking
      when compared to retyping everything from scratch.</p>
